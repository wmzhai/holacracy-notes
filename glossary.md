按照逻辑接受顺序罗列，而不是字母顺序。

**角色 Role**

组织内部的一个实体，用来定义组织的某种功能。角色的具体定义包括目标，管辖领域和岗位职责。角色的产生，修改和删除仅通过圈子的管理过程完成。

**目标 Purpose**

一个角色或者圈子的意图。

The Purpose orients the action of a Role even absent any other explicit Accountabilities, Policies, Strategies, Priorities, or resources.

**管辖领域 Domain**

**岗位职责 Accountability**

**圈子 Circle**

由具备同一目标的一组角色组成，每个圈子都具备一些 **核心角色** (比如协调员，秘书，引导连接和代表连接)和从事实际工作的角色。

A group of Roles that all contribute to the same Purpose. Every Circle has “core roles” (e.g. Facilitator, Secretary, Lead Link, and Rep Link) as well as other Roles doing the work. A Circle is treated like a Role with the additional authority to break itself down into sub-Roles.

**根本圈子 Anchor Circle**

将整个组织包含在内的最大的一二圈子。


**引导连接 Lead Link**

A Role that holds the Purpose of the overall Circle. The Lead Link is responsible for assigning people to Roles that have been created through Governance Meetings. The Lead Link also allocates resources and defines Priorities, Strategies, and Metrics within the Circle.

**代表连接 Rep Link**

An elected Role used to represent the interests of a sub-Circle to its super-Circle. Also note that the Lead Link of a Circle may not serve as the Rep Link of that Circle.

**协调员 Facilitator**

协调员就像是一个运动的裁判员，一个中立、公正的角色，是为了保护游戏进程，维护游戏规则而设计的。

**秘书 Secretary**

An elected Role with the Purpose of aligning Circle Governance and operations with the Constitution through maintaining Circle records, scheduling meetings, and interpreting Governance upon request. The Secretary works actively and collaboratively with the Facilitator during Governance and Tactical Meetings.

**管理 Governance**

An explicit, written set of rules and expectations including the Circles, Roles, Purposes, Accountabilities, Domains, and Policies of the organization. The organization’s Governance changes in response to the demands of the environment through the processing of Circle member’s Tensions during Governance Meetings.

Governance Meetings follow the process outlined in Constitution section 3.3.


**Metrics**

Data chosen by the Circle’s Lead Link to provide visibility into the work of the Circle. For example, a Metric for a “Social Media” Role might be “Number of Twitter followers.” It is up to the Lead Link of the Circle to define and assign relevant metrics to the Roles within that Circle.


**Objection**

An Objection is a reason why a Governance Proposal will cause harm or move the Circle backward. A Circle member raises an Objection during a Governance Meeting when that member experiences a Tension in response to the Proposal.

**政策 Policy**

影响圈子或者角色管辖领域的授权或者限制，当圈子拥有管辖领域(Domain)时，圈子可以在管理会议上制定相应政策，或者允许圈子以外的角色对该管辖领域施以影响，或阻止自己圈子内的角色以某种方式对该财产施以影响。

A Policy allows or limits others from impacting a Domain. For example, if a “Social Media” Role owns the Domain of “corporate Twitter account” then a Policy might be enacted to allow an “Events Promotion” Role to make posts to Twitter (e.g. “Events Promotion has permission to post events-related content to the corporate Twitter account”).


**战术会议 Tactical Meeting**
