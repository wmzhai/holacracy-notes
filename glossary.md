按照逻辑接受顺序罗列，而不是字母顺序。

**章程 Constitution**

The documents that defines the fundamental rules, processes, and other constructs of the Holacracy system for organizational governance and operations. Within an organization running Holacracy, the Constitution is the formal power-holder in the organization rather than a specific person (e.g. CEO, President, etc.)

**张力 Tension**

事物应有状态与所处状态之间的差距。

A person’s felt sense that there is a gap between the current reality and a potential future. The Circle processes member’s Tensions during its Governance and Tactical meetings. This approach ensures that Governance and operational changes are driven by real experience rather than theory.

**角色 Role**

An organizational entity used to define certain functions of the organization. The definition of a Role includes a Purpose to express, Domain(s) to control, and Accountabilities to perform. The only way for a Role to be created, revised, or destroyed is through the Circle’s Governance process.

**目标 Purpose**

Clarifies the identity and intention of a Role or Circle. The Purpose orients the action of a Role even absent any other explicit Accountabilities, Policies, Strategies, Priorities, or resources.

**管辖领域 Domain**

Similar to a property right, a Domain centralizes control of a resource to a specific Role. For example, a “Social Media” Role might own the Domain of “corporate Twitter account.” A Role may impact its own Domain to achieve its Purpose, but may not impact another’s Domain unless given permission.

**岗位职责 Accountability**

An ongoing activity expected of a Role. Accountabilities can only be added to roles or circles via the governance process. They’re captured as full sentences that begin with an –ing verb. For example, a “Website Manager” Role might have an accountability for “Building and maintaining the company’s website.”

**圈子 Circle**

由具备同一目标的一组角色组成，每个圈子都具备一些 **核心角色** (比如 ，秘书，链长和)和从事实际工作的角色。

A group of Roles that all contribute to the same Purpose. Every Circle has “core roles” (e.g. Facilitator, Secretary, Lead Link, and Rep Link) as well as other Roles doing the work. A Circle is treated like a Role with the additional authority to break itself down into sub-Roles.

**根本圈子 Anchor Circle**

将整个组织包含在内的最大的一二圈子。


**链长 Lead Link**

A Role that holds the Purpose of the overall Circle. The Lead Link is responsible for assigning people to Roles that have been created through Governance Meetings. The Lead Link also allocates resources and defines Priorities, Strategies, and Metrics within the Circle.

链长对自己圈的工作没有决定权，他唯一的权力是往自己圈里的角色中放人。他可以在全公司范围内邀请任何人来填充角色，并且有权在认为一个人没有做好自己角色的时候将其从角色上踢出。

**代表连接 Rep Link**

An elected Role used to represent the interests of a sub-Circle to its super-Circle. Also note that the Lead Link of a Circle may not serve as the Rep Link of that Circle. Rep Links allow Tensions from the sub-Circle to be processed by the super-Circle when the issue seems to extend beyond the sub-Circle’s current authority.

**协调员 Facilitator**

An elected Role with the purpose of facilitating the Circle’s Governance and Tactical meetings in accordance with the rules of the Constitution. The Facilitator’s Purpose and Accountabilities are listed in the Constitution’s Appendix. Also, the Lead Link of a Circle is not eligible to be elected Facilitator for that Circle.


**秘书 Secretary**

An elected Role with the Purpose of aligning Circle Governance and operations with the Constitution through maintaining Circle records, scheduling meetings, and interpreting Governance upon request. The Secretary works actively and collaboratively with the Facilitator during Governance and Tactical Meetings.


**Cross Link**

A Role within a Circle used to represent the interests and Tensions of an external Circle or organization. When a Circle is created within another Circle, a Rep Link (as opposed to a Cross Link) will be used to represent the interests of the sub-Circle at the Super-Circle.


**选举 Election**

An integrative process for selecting people to fill the Facilitator Role, Secretary Role, and Rep Link Role. Elections follow the Integrative Election Process that includes nominations and the processing of Proposals and Objections.


**Individual Action**

An action taken outside the current Purpose or Accountabilities of a Role. The decision to take Individual Action should be made consciously having considered the current Governance, and involves certain duties as a follow up to avoid repeating the same Individual Action.

**管理 Governance**

An explicit, written set of rules and expectations including the Circles, Roles, Purposes, Accountabilities, Domains, and Policies of the organization. The organization’s Governance changes in response to the demands of the environment through the processing of Circle member’s Tensions during Governance Meetings.

**管理会议 Governance Meeting**

A recurring meeting to process Tensions related to the Circle’s Governance by making Proposals and raising Objections. Changes can be made to the Circle’s Governance by creating new or making changes to existing Roles, Policies, and Elections. Governance Meetings follow the process outlined in Constitution section 3.3.


**Metrics**

Data chosen by the Circle’s Lead Link to provide visibility into the work of the Circle. For example, a Metric for a “Social Media” Role might be “Number of Twitter followers.” It is up to the Lead Link of the Circle to define and assign relevant metrics to the Roles within that Circle.


**Objection**

An Objection is a reason why a Governance Proposal will cause harm or move the Circle backward. A Circle member raises an Objection during a Governance Meeting when that member experiences a Tension in response to the Proposal.

**政策 Policy**

影响圈子或者角色管辖领域的授权或者限制，当圈子拥有管辖领域(Domain)时，圈子可以在管理会议上制定相应政策，或者允许圈子以外的角色对该管辖领域施以影响，或阻止自己圈子内的角色以某种方式对该财产施以影响。

A Policy allows or limits others from impacting a Domain. For example, if a “Social Media” Role owns the Domain of “corporate Twitter account” then a Policy might be enacted to allow an “Events Promotion” Role to make posts to Twitter (e.g. “Events Promotion has permission to post events-related content to the corporate Twitter account”).

**项目 Project**

通过一系列顺序的行动而想要达成的特定结果。

A Project is a specific outcome that requires multiple and/or sequential actions to complete. Projects are phrased in the past tense as in, “Budget report completed.” All Circle members are required to capture and track Projects for their Roles in a tangible form and to regularly review and update them.


**下一步行动 Next Action**

在没有其他更紧急事情的情况下，可以立刻执行的、具体的、实际的行动。

A concrete action that could be taken immediately towards the completion of a Project. All Circle members are required to capture and track Next Actions for their Roles in a tangible form and to regularly review and update them.

项目和下一步行动的区别：

* **项目** 是“任何想要达成的结果，他需要很多步行动才能实现”
* **下一步行动** 是”为了将现状推向完成状态，接下来要从事的实际的具体的行动”

**Proposal**

A recommended change to the Circle’s Governance presented by a Circle member during a Governance Meeting. A Proposal is based on the proposer’s felt Tension and may involve as many parts as necessary to resolve that Tension.


**战略 Strategy**

An easy-to-remember rule used to guide Circle member’s decisions. A Strategy defines one potentially valuable activity, emphasis, or goal over another. The Lead Link is accountable for defining the Strategies of the Circle and may use whatever process he/she feels is appropriate for gathering input from other Circle members.

**战术会议 Tactical Meeting**

A recurring meeting for Circle members to surface operational data, updates, and triage Tensions into Projects and Next Actions. Agenda items are created during the meeting while the Facilitator works to get through all items in the allotted time. Tactical Meetings follow the process outlined in Constitution section 4.2.
